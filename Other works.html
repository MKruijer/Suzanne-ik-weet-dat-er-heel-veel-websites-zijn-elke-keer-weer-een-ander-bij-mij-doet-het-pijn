is the second book in Suzanne Collins's children's novel series The Underland Chronicles.[3] Published in 2004, the novel contains elements of high fantasy.[1] The novel focuses on a prophecy mentioned at the end of Gregor the Overlander which the Underlanders believe requires the protagonist Gregor to hunt down and kill an evil white rat known as the "Bane".
